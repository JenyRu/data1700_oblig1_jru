Short description of application:
A JavaScript and HTML application that registers movie ticket orders.
I added three imaginary movie alternatives and five input boxes for 
ticket amount, first name, last name, phone number and email. 
The "Buy Ticket"-button can only be clicked if the input is validated. 
When the form is submitted successfully the input are sent as objects 
to an array and displayed under "Current Tickets". This will simultaneously 
reset the input field. Lastly the "Delete Current Tickets"-button will 
empty the array when clicked.
